# ASU Biological Data Science Capstone Project
## Group 12. Graduation: May 2025
### C. Bony, E. Choo, A. Colvin, and K. Mansukhani

### Project Purpose: 
This is a capstone project required for graduation from the MS BDS program at ASU. 

### Research Purpose:
Short: to create models that further our understanding of patient outcomes after organ transplant surgery. 

Long: To identify and analyze key demographic and clinical factors that influence organ transplant outcomes by examining patterns in survival rates and graft success. These analyses will encompass different patient populations, organ types, and donor characteristics. Our main goal is to uncover insights that can support informed clinical decision making.


### Data Source:
Data is sourced from the US Health Resources & Services Administration.
